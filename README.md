# Super Resolution Generative Adversial Network (SR-GAN) Image upsampling
  - An implement of SRGAN for tensorflow version.
  - Objective: Enhance the resolution of low-resolution images to produce high-resolution versions while preserving details and realism

# Requirements
    Libraries required:
    1. cv2: Image processing
    2. NumPy: For numerical computations.
    3. Matplotlib: For data visualization.
    4. Pillow: For image manipulation.
    5. TensorFlow: Depending on your chosen deep  learning framework.
  
# Applications
  Such applications which would be benefitted with the help of "SR-GAN" are:
  1. Enhancing Image Quality
  2. Zoom and Crop
  3. Art Restoration
  4. Medical Imaging
  5. Surveillance and Security
